# Thinkful-Capstone-Projects
**The scenario for this project:** I am consulting as a data analyst for Lariat. 
They've hired me to make recommendations about how to make **better decisions**, 
which they measure in terms of the **costs and revenue** generated **by** their **rental car fleet**.

They've provided me with raw data in **four Excel worksheets** in four workbooks.

They've asked me to **produce** the following **deliverables** based on the raw data and the business objectives:

- An **Excel model** that they can use to make data-informed decisions about their fleet. 
  This should be based on the **observed costs** **and revenue data** **from their fleet in recent years**.
- A **PowerPoint** deck that provides an **analysis of the problem** and **provides recommendations**.
- A **live presentation** in which you present your findings to a Lariat executive.

Note

In this scenario, I jump straight into exploring the raw data.
